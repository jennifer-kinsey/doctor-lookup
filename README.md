### Known Bugs
The data in this API isn't complete. There isn't always, for example, a practice name. The workaround is using the js OR operator to fill in blanks.
```
var office = result.practices[0].name || "unavailable";
```

Additionally, the entire practice part of the json file may not exist.

As a result, Sometimes the results for the doctor query will say there are 10 results and only 4 present on the page due to data not being available in the API.
