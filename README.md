### Known Bugs
The information returned back for the doctor results was limited to name, website, city, state, and phone. There was an issue in the way the data was being expected for other categories. Eg - if you were requesting the last name of the physician and it didn't exist, an error occurred on load. There were several key/value pairs not available for all entries. With lack of workaround, this author decided to limit what data was pulled to avoid not missing results.
